# Tala

## A cloud based MDX editor built for simplicity



Still work in progress
### Techstack
- Next JS
- Tailwind



#### Still thinking of what to use
- **DB**
Still thinking how to store data if I should store it in a database that I manage or if I should just let users store their files in Github or Google drive

- **Authentication**
I don't know what authentication service to use, if I should use OAuth or NextAuth. or should I use services like Clerk or AuthO

- might just go f*ck it and go with supabase or firebase for both auth and db


## Roadmap and future features
- LaTex support
- Doc support
- PDF export with code highlighting for code blocks
- Mobile and Desktop app
- Vim motions support
